## About This Project

EduFlow is a comprehensive School Management Dashboard built with Next.js. I'm following the tutorial instructions provided by [Lama Dev](https://youtu.be/6sfiAyKy8Jo) to learn modern web development practices and build this school management system, which I've personalized as "My EduFlow".

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

First, install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

```

Open (http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
